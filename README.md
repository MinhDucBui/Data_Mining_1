#  Predicting Retweets of @realDonaldTrump Twitter account.

## Abstract

Twitter is one of the most popular platforms for expressing opinions, thoughts and updates, but it is also used to influence people and is a "tactic" widely used in election campaigns. President Donald Trump's Twitter account is very popular, his tweet frequency is relatively high, and his tweets are liked and retweeted hundreds of thousands of times.
This notebook implements a regression model to predict the number of retweets of a particular tweet from @realdonaldtrump. Additionally the meaning of features is evaluated and compared.

The result of this notebook is, besides the prediction model, a set of important characteristics for a high number of retweets. These can be used to increase the retweet rate of candidates for future election campaigns. Our model can be used to decide on which parts to focus on when tweeting (length, specific hashtags, time of day, etc.) in order to maximize the number of retweets and gain popularity or even become viral.

Potential improvements:
* Mine data directly from twitter
* Improve feature generation
* Improve model
* Improve explainability
* Implement a dashboard for predicting the number of retweets of a new tweet
